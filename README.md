## 🧩 About

This repository is designed as a **Hacktoberfest 2025 starter kit**. It encourages new contributors to get hands-on with open source by submitting small code snippets, utilities, demos, or fixes.  

Anyone — beginners or experienced devs — can pick up issues, add features, or share sample code.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Provide **low-barrier issues** for new open-source contributors  
- Host **mini-tools, examples, and demos** (scripts, algorithms, utilities)  
- Grow a welcoming community of learners and contributors  
- Help participants qualify for Hacktoberfest by contributing here  

---

## 🛠 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (if some tools/scripts use JavaScript)  
- A code editor (VS Code, Sublime, etc.)  
- Basic familiarity with Git and GitHub  

### Installation

```bash
# Clone your fork or the original repo
git clone https://github.com/Tanmaydeep/hacktober-fest-2025.git
cd hacktober-fest-2025

# (Optional) If there are dependencies:
npm install
````

### Running / Testing

If a particular example or demo tool has a script, run:

```bash
npm run start        # or whatever script is defined
# or
node path/to/script.js
```

Check the individual folders for README or instructions if available.

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome everyone — especially first-time open source contributors.

### Project Ideas

Some ideas you can contribute:

* Utility scripts (string manipulation, date helpers, small algorithms)
* Mini web components or HTML/CSS/JS demos
* Bug fixes, documentation improvements
* Code samples (sorting, searching, recursion, etc.)

If you have more ideas, feel free to create an issue first and discuss before coding.

### How to Submit (PR Flow)

1. **Fork** this repository

2. **Create a branch** for your feature/fix, e.g. `feat/unique-id-generator`

3. **Make your changes** in that branch

4. **Commit your changes** with a clear message

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add unique ID generator utility"
   ```

5. **Push** your branch to your fork

   ```bash
   git push origin feat/unique-id-generator
   ```

6. **Open a Pull Request** against `main` in the original repo

   * Use a title like: `feat: add unique ID generator`
   * In the description, mention `Closes #<issue-number>` if applicable
   * Provide context, examples, screenshots if relevant

7. Wait for review — maintainers may ask for small changes or improvements.
